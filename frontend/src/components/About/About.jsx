            <h2>Hi I&#39;m Connor!</h2>
            <p>I&#39;m a software engineer from Calgary, Alberta.</p>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m a third year student at the University of British Columbia
              studying computer science. Looking for software engineer
              internships!
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy connectioning with people, exploring new technology, and
              developing cool projects with a particular interest in fullstack
              development. Outside of tech - you can find me competing in sports
              such as volleyball and bouldering, hiking up mountains with
              friends, or just listening to good music ðŸ˜„
