A web application that makes traveling fun, engaging, and accessible. Utilizing the power of artificial intelligence, this web application offers real-time personalized feedback through integration with the OpenAI API. I aim to ease the process of planning a long trip, where users can not only learn about tourist destinations but also find local spots special to the city they are traveling to.
